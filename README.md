Predictive Analytics for Movie Success and Employee Retention

Welcome to the Predictive Analytics for Movie Success and Employee Retention project repository. 

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the success of movies and forecast employee retention, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making.

This project consists of two main parts:

Movie Success Prediction: Analyzing various factors such as genre, rating, and runtime to predict the success of movies with an accuracy of 98.8%.

Employee Retention Forecasting: Evaluating critical factors like commute distance, age, and monthly income to forecast employee attrition with 90% accuracy, enabling targeted retention strategies.

Datasets

Movie Dataset: Contains information about various movies including genre, rating, runtime, and other relevant features.

Employee Dataset: Includes details such as employee age, commute distance, monthly income, and other critical factors affecting retention.
I
